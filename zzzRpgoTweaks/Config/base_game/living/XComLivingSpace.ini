;with the defaults, this gives two upgrades maxing out at 60 crew

;if ROBOTICS take space in the CREW too, this will add the number of robotics you have that are more than the number of Repair Bays (engineering staff slots)
;base game has at maximum 2 repair bays, with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2165999454 Expanded Robotics you can get upto 6
;so if you have 3 sparks and a proxian (4 robotic units), but only 2 repair bays, this option will add 2 to your crew count
;yes Proxians don't USE the repair bays, but they DO count as 'robotic' units

;in this config, we'll use the definitions used in the TrainingDefinitions folder, and set up some mutual exclusivity.
;In principle, this all can be done in the same config file. I did it this way for clarity of presentation.
;So for example, let's replicate LW1's rules: officers, mecs, and psionics are mutually exclusive, mecs can't be gene modded and vice versa.
;Note that this related is not symmetric, so you must specify both directions manually.

;all of that is commented by default, so the mod does nothing really. Please READ these configs, and the comments, and understand what they do. If you are happy with the results, uncomment to activate!

;+IncompatibleTraining = "PsionicClass"

;;DANGER: if you started training someone as an officer, and they're revealed to be psionically gifted, they won't be able to do either:
;;they can't do psi training since they're officers, and they can't do officer training since they have the gift.

[PsionicClass X2TrainingTemplate]
;;In this case, restricting officers from being psi class is impossible - since there's no such a thing as rookie officers anyway, then if you're already an officer, then you have a class, so it's too late to prevent you from being psionic class...
;+IncompatibleTraining = "MecChopping"
;;stll makes sense to ban mec chopping.

[PsioncallyGifted X2TrainingTemplate]
;+IncompatibleTraining = "OfficerTraining"
;;however with psi overhaul's system, adding the officer training restriction is meaningful. BUT, still see the DANGER above.

;as another set of an example, we'll disable rangers from going into soldier conditioning. Again, this can be achieved with configs in Soldier Conditioning mod, but this shows this mechanism at work, so that users can adapt it to other rules.

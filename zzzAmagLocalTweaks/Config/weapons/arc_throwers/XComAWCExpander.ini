; the stuct entries of AWC_AbilityStructs contain two arrays on names:
;WeaponCats
;these are the weapon categories that the class template must be able to equip in order to be allowed to pick the associated abilities in the AWC
;will only check the soldier's primary and secondary slots.

;AbilityNames
;this is the list of abilities that will be blocked if the soldier can't equip any of the associated WeaponCats.
;putting the same ability name in two differnet structs with different weaponcats will just get the blocked if they don't qualify for both lists. so, try to avoid doing that.

;in addition to setting up a struct here, also set up the lines in ClassData to make sure they qualify as AWC skills and have an appropriate default slot.
;you may also want to set up appropriate ATSR configuration if not already provided by the perk pack/etc.

; this example adds vanilla gremlin abilities to the AWC for classes that can use gremlins or sparkbits.

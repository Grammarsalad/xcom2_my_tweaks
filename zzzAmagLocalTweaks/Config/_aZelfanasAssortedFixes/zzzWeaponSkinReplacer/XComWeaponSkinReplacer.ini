; Config duplicated from Configurable Return Fire. This is needed to support SkirmisherReturnFire with other weapon types.
;   Also, WSR is used as Template Master does not have this kind of functionality of affecting whole weapon categories.

; Adding PistolReturnFire to weapons, these won't do anything without the companion ability.
; Pistols, Bullpups and Autopistols already have PistolReturnFire, no need to add this to them.
; Sniper Rifles don't get PistolReturnFire as Sharpshooters use their Pistols for that.

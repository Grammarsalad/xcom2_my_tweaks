[AUReduxPlayableAliens.X2EventListener_AlienCapture]
NormalChance = 25; 25% chance to capture an alien unit via fultoning.
FriendlyChance = 0 ; when a defector (or mind controlled alien) successfully evacs or is fultoned out of a mission, this is their chance of becoming a recruit for XCOM.

Injury = 2; //a unit's lost HP is multiplied by this. So an advent captain that started with 12 HP, then got fultoned at 1 HP, would have a 47% chance to be captured with the default of 2.

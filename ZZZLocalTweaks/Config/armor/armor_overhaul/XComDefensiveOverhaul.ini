[WOTCDefensiveItemOverhaul2.X2DownloadableContentInfo_WOTCDefensiveItemOverhaul2]

;	===============================================================================================================
;	Any armor item that has an ability from this list will have the Defensive Overhaul Ablative Plating added to it,
;	which will provide a bonus amount of Shield HP depending on Ablative Plating upgrades you have purchased.

; Armor Overhaul works by attaching an additional passive ability that grants variable amount of Ablative HP.
; That passive ability can be added either directly to armor item template (which is what PatchArmorItems does), 
; or as an AdditionalAbility to another passive ability that is already present on that armor item (which is what PatchArmorStatAbilities does).


;	Compatibility with armors from "Heavy And Light Kevlar Armors" mod.

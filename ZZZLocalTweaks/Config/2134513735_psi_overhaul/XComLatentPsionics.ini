;default chance of a soldier being psionic - wouldn't recommend higher than 25%
PSI_CHANCE=30 
;/100

;Should rookies be tested to be come Psions? (SEE NOTE in PER CLASS SECTION BELOW)
AllowRookiesToBeTested=false

;per class chance
;NOTE: in order for this to work with non-faction XCOM Unit classes, AllowRookiesToBeTested MUST BE SET TO FALSE
;      otherwise XCOM soldiers will *only* be tested at Rookie rank!
;NOTE: faction characters are rarer in vanilla, so I recommend setting their chances to be no less than 25%
;NOTE: This is using the class's TEMPLATE NAME (look it up in the game's and/or mods' config files if you don't know)

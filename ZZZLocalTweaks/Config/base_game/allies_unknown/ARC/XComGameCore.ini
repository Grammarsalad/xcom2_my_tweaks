;100(?)% chance of getting a soldier as an "alternate" robot like the EWR or Geth soldier types if those mods are installed.
;Spark Robot Chance is rolled if you get a robot (or you don't have any humanoid robot mods installed), since other mods may handle SPARKS and similar types of units like MEC Troopers differently.
;so I don't intrude on them too much
;otherwise, you just get a normal human

;default settings is that you always get a Tech Commando when you don't get a T-Doll, UNLESS it's a unit that gets a class by default like a SPARK or Geth Prime.

;set to disable to have it follow standard character pool settings, else it generates random soldiers

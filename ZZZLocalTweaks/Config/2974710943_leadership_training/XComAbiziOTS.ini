;MOD COMPATIBILITY CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
;AddCompatiblityRules is a struct of type ModCompatibilityOfficerData. It has the following fields:
;Action - Mandatory. Can be given one of three values  ModifyTrainingTime, BanFromOfficerTraining, CountAsAlternativeOfficer
;the rest of the fields are optional
;CharacterTemplateName - character template this rule will apply to (e.g., SparkSoldier)
;SoldierClassName - soldier class name this rule will apply to (e.g., Sharpshooter)
;AbilityName - required ability to have for this rule to apply. 
;UnitValueName - required unit value on the unit for this rule to apply. If this field is used, then the following is also necessary:
;RequiredUnitValue - if the value of the unit value is at least this number, the rule will apply.
;TrainingTimeModifier - multiplier on training time. Required if the action is ModifyTrainingTime
;CountAsOfficerRank - will make soldiers count as an officer of this level, ONLY for the purpose of covert ops/infiltrations/sitrep officer requirements. Only useful if the action is CountAsAlternativeOfficer
;
; Never Again chars count as officers
+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = CountAsAlternativeOfficer, UnitValueName = "AbiziGotPTSDBefore", RequiredUnitValue = 1, CountAsOfficerRank = 3)
; Resistance leaders count as officers and they train (much) more quickly
+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = CountAsAlternativeOfficer, SoldierClassName = "WOTC_APA_DirectorKelly", CountAsOfficerRank = 3)
+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = ModifyTrainingTime, SoldierClassName = "WOTC_APA_DirectorKelly", TrainingTimeModifier = 0.1)

;for brevity, try to keep it "one instruction per line". If multiple rules apply to a given soldier, the best one will be picked.
;training time modifier will always make training shorter, you can't make it longer with this config.
;examples
;ban spark from training
;+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = BanFromOfficerTraining, CharacterTemplateName = "SparkSoldier")
;use the "Battlefield Tactician" as a level 2 officer. If you PUT such a soldier into officer training, and bring them to level 3, then level 3 will be used. They will begin from level 0 as usual, and their abilities will use their "usual" officer level parameters, and not these. This ONLY counts for requirements for covert ops or missions.
;note that this doesn't prevent them from training normally and becoming "real" officers. If you want that, then you need to ban them with the BanOfficerFromTraining command.
;+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = CountAsAlternativeOfficer, SoldierClassName = "AbiziOfficer", CountAsOfficerRank = 2)
;soldiers who had thier officer bondmate die can train faster
;+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = ModifyTrainingTime, UnitValueName = "AbiziOTS_OfficerBondmateDied", RequiredUnitValue = 1, TrainingTimeModifier = 0.75)
;will prevent psionically gifted soldiers from Psi Overhaul V3 to become officers:
;AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = BanFromOfficerTraining, AbilityName = "TheGift")
;note that this won't work in reverse - an officer CAN be revealed to be psionically gifted. In this case, they won't be able to train anymore, but will be able to psi train. Do this at your own risk. 

;will prevent soldiers who had conditioning training from going on officer training. Again, in reverse it will work, so use at your own risk.
;+AddCompatibilityRules = (Action = BanFromOfficerTraining, UnitValueName = "TR_SoldierConditioning", RequiredUnitValue = 1)
